## Float Note

### What is it?

Flot Note (in lack of a better name) is a bare-bones note taking app for taking notes and nothing else. It is inspired a by a real bulletin board as you, as a user, have one *board* where your notes are stored. You can drag the notes around the board, you can resize them and you the edit the stacking order of the notes. Additionally, you can do a little bit of styling of each note.

### Why did I create it?

I created this app mostly to practice my programming skills. Secondly, because I think it's a cool way to jot down things you want to remember, or keep a list of, say, easy go-to recipes.

### What technologies did I use?

The backend is built with Node/Express and MongoDB.
